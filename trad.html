        <h1> traditions & culture of Chamba </h1>
        <h2><u>Chamba miniature paintings</u></h2>
         <p> Chamba is noted for its miniature Pahari paintings,[41] where Basohli style of Pahari paintings took roots with Nikku, the artist of Basohli migrating from Guler to Chamba in the eighteenth century. Raja Udai Singh and Raja Jai Singh patronised this school of painting.[42] During the reign of Raja Charhat Singh, folk art developed and had a lasting influence on local artists. The paintings of Chamba encompass both miniatures and murals and the Mughal influence is clearly discerned in these paintings.[42] Distinguished artists of Chamba who have painted in this art form include Lehru, Durga and Miyan Jara Singh. The paintings were generally painted with Hindu religious themes, particularly the legends of Hindu mythology such as Radha Krishna, Shiva-Parvati, Rama Darbar, Yashoda and Krishna, Gopis, love scenes, deer, birds and women, Daya Saptashati and Krishna - Sudama.[41][43] Romantic ambiance of the monsoon season in Chamba has also been painted by the artists of Pahari miniature art, in various moods and styles in Basholi colours. They are displayed in the museums at Chamba and also at Shimla and Dharamsala
            Minjar fair has been declared as one of the state fairs of Himachal Pradesh. Wide coverage is given on TV and print media. Undoubtedly Chamba is at its very best during this fair that generally falls in the month of July/ August.<br></p>
       <h2><u> Handicrafts and musical instruments</u> </h2>
         <p>Chamba is an important centre for the making of traditional handicrafts, and the town has numerous small workshops maintained by the artisans. Many of the items produced are exquisite and lavish, testament to the towns' aristocratic heritage.[45]
         Casting metalware in Chamba is an ancient tradition, dating back to the Bronze Age period, with items typically made out of copper or brass, and also iron, especially in the traditional making of implements and weapons by blacksmiths. Of particular note in this trade are the large plaques with reliefs, commonly used for wall decoration. The temple cupolas in Chamba district are often furnished with copper and brass items made in Chamba and often the golden kalasha or vessel crowning them is produced here.[45]
         Chamba has its own unique traditional system of men's and women's footwear. Traditional footwear was originally made from locally produced leather but is today transported to Chamba from the south of India.[45] Women's footwear is embroidered as is "vegetarian" footwear which is purposefully made without leather for use in places where leather is prohibited for religious reasons. Handkerchiefs and shawls are also made in abundance in Chamba. Traditionally hand-spun, they are designed in such a way as to make both sides of the cloth look identical, and are beautifully embroidered.[45] Chamba shawls are woven on hand looms in wool and typically have a bright border in a traditional design.[45] A similar woven design is used for making caps.
         Traditional jewellery is made in gold and silver in Chamba as its pottery, typically kitchenware, utensils and earthen pots.[45] Given Chamba's history of new immigration from other parts of the country and Tibet, a variety of influences can be seen in the pieces of jewellery that are produced in Chamba.[45] Chamba is also noted for its wood carvings, which, like the metalware is often used for iconography in temples, such as Chamunda Devi.[46] A "Nagara", a form of kettle drum is produced in Chamba as are cymbals, bells and "Singa" or "Ransinga" (horns) produced in both straight and curved styles.[45] Other instruments include Shankh, Nad, Beiunsuli, Saihna, Nag Pheni, Thali Ghada, Bhana, Karnal, Pohol, Dhons, Kahal, Kansi, Hasat Ghanta and Drugg.<br></p>
       <h2><u>Festivals, fairs and dances</u></h2>
         <p>Chamba is one of those places where Basohli effect actually reached. Two melas or fairs, also known as Jatras, are of particular note in Chamba; "Suhi Mata Mela" and "Minjar Mela". A notable event of such fairs is when the ‘chela’. a subordinate of the deity who is being worshipped goes into a trance and answers the queries and prayers of the devotees.[48]
            An important festival held in Chamba is known as the "Suhi Mata Mela". It is held annually in March–April for four days to commemorate the sacrifice made by the queen of Chamba with her life, to bring water to the town. The legend associated with this festival and the Sui Mata temple, built in memory of the queen (wife of Raja Sahil Varman), relates to the sacrifice she made to fulfill a prophecy in a dream, which said that water from the Sarota stream could only be accessed through an aqueduct if the queen or her son was sacrificed. Rather than kill her own son she sacrificed her own life for the town. To commemorate this event, women and children take a lead role in the festival. An image of Champavati, with banners of the Rajput solar emblem, are taken by them in a procession, dancing and singing, through the Chaugan to the Suhi Mata temple.[3][20][48]
            Another popular festival held in Chamba is the "Minjar Mela", held on the second Sunday of the Shravana month, corresponding to the month of August in the Gregorian calendar. It marks the triumph of the Raja of Chamba over the ruler of Trigarta (now called as Kangra), in 935 AD and also celebrates the paddy and maize crops grown at this time of the year.[22] The festival commences with offerings of 'minjar', consisting of a bunch of paddy plant and golden silk wrapped in red fabric.[22] The offerings also include a rupee, a seasonal fruit, and a coconut.[22] This occasion is also celebrated with a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaugan that initiates a week of cultural and social programmes.[22] The image of the deity, Lord Raghuvira, and more than 200 other deities, are taken in a procession, in a chariot pulled by ropes. Folk dances and music performances known as 'Kunjari Malhar' are part of the festivities. On the last day of the festival, a parade is held from the Akhand Chandi Palace to Ravi River, where offerings are made to the river.[22] This commemorates an event in which Raja Sahil Verman changed the course of the river, to make the Hari Rai temple accessible to all devotees.[48][49]
            Chamba and the surrounding district have many local customs in dancing, illustrating the differences in geographical, anthropological and social cultures and religious beliefs in the area.[50] A solo dance or a dance of two people such as the Pharati or Khad-dumbi is commonly performed during the Nuwala ceremony and other important occasions, such as marriages etc. and the Dangri and Sikri are said to be of note.[50][51] Notable male dances include the Gaddi and Gujjar dances, Dandaras, Nat, Ghorda, Nachan, Dharumsde, the Khad-dumbi and the Chhinjhati.[52] Notable female dances include the Ghurei, Dangi and Kikli, whilst dances such as the Shain, Dhamal, Sohal, Sal Kukdi Nachan, Ratege and Til-Chauti are performed by both sexes.[53] Several forms of masked dance are also performed in Chamba, such as the Chhatradhi Jatar<br></p>
       <h2><u>Costumes</u></h2>
         <p>Ancient people of Chamba were known to have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as evidenced by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion.[54] The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope.[31] A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.[54]
"The Jakatas, the Milinda Panha and the Vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadins mention the beautifully embroidered Kotumbara clothes of the Audumbara country (Pathankot and Chamba) and the fine textiles captured in the lot of Kangra Fort in 1009 around the astonishment of the soldiers of Mahmud of Ghazni. A heavier, though not less luxurious type of embriodered dresses can be traced on the fountain stones, which had been erected by the local aristocracy of Churah, in western Chamba in the 11th to 12th centuries." - Hermann Goetz[54]
Given the history of migrants arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba has a variety of traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stole) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.[55]
            Muslim women also generally wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one difference is that the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called an angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common.[55] Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.<br></p>
            <h2><u>Music of Chamba</u></h2>
            <p>Devotional songs known as 'Ainchali' are sung throughout the night. The 'Chella' is summoned who goes into a Tranceas soon as the sacrifices are referred to Lord Shiva. He is said to be possessed of the Lord himself. He answers the questions put to him by members of the family and their friends.
            Chambyal (people of Chamba) enjoy the traditional folk music of their area. This consists of folk songs, dances and folklores and these are accompanied by various musical instruments. Their love for folk music is evident from their keen interest in folk music which is different from that of other regions. Folk songs of Gaddis can be categorised as marriage songs, festivity songs, love songs.
            Marriage Songs The theme of the marriage songs is mostly related to the selection of groom and the girl's wishes regarding it. The songs which are sung at the time of wedding ceremony are known as 'Charlai' and these songs depict that the relatives of the bride and groom seek the blessings from the God.
            Festivity Songs Chambyals celebrate many fairs and festivals with great pump and show. They sing many songs which are usually accompanied by folk dances. Major folk songs are - 'Sukart and Ghanihar', 'Kunjadi Malhar' during Minjar Mela, 'Ainchali' on Nuala, songs related to Baisakhi at the time of 'Basoa' and 'Kunjadi' songs of the rainy season are sung during Patroru festival.
            Love Songs These songs are of Shrinagar rasa. Mostly the feelings of separation, hard life of Gaddis, their social bindings and the tales of sacrifice, unsuccessful love etc. are depicted through these songs. Famous Love songs are, 'Kunju and Chanchlo', 'Phulmu and Ranjhu', 'Raja Gaddan' and 'Bhunku Gaddi' that are very popular among the city and the state<br></p>
